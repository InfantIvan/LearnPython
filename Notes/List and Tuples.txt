Let's create a Python program that demonstrates the characteristics of lists and tuples using multiple classes, along with detailed explanations.

```python
class DataContainer:
    """Base class for data containers (lists and tuples)."""

    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def display_data(self):
        """Displays the contained data."""
        print(self.data)

    def get_length(self):
        """Returns the length (number of elements) of the data."""
        return len(self.data)


class MyList(DataContainer):
    """Represents a list (mutable sequence)."""

    def modify_element(self, index, new_value):
        """Modifies an element at the specified index."""
        if 0 <= index < self.get_length():
            self.data[index] = new_value
        else:
            print("Invalid index for modification.")

    def append_element(self, new_value):
        """Appends a new element to the end of the list."""
        self.data.append(new_value)


class MyTuple(DataContainer):
    """Represents a tuple (immutable sequence)."""

    def try_modify_element(self, index, new_value):
        """Attempts to modify an element (will raise an error)."""
        try:
            self.data[index] = new_value
        except TypeError:
            print("Tuples are immutable. Modification not allowed.")


# Create instances of lists and tuples
my_list = MyList([1, 2, 3])
my_tuple = MyTuple((4, 5, 6))

# Display initial data
print("Initial List:")
my_list.display_data()
print("Initial Tuple:")
my_tuple.display_data()

# Modify and append to the list
my_list.modify_element(1, 10)  # Change the second element
my_list.append_element(7)
print("\nModified List:")
my_list.display_data()

# Attempt to modify the tuple (will raise an error)
my_tuple.try_modify_element(0, 100)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`DataContainer`:**
    - Base class for common functionalities of lists and tuples.
    - `__init__`: Initializes the data container with the provided data.
    - `display_data`: Prints the data.
    - `get_length`: Returns the number of elements in the data.

- **`MyList`:**
    - Inherits from `DataContainer`.
    - `modify_element`: Modifies an element at a given index if the index is valid.
    - `append_element`: Appends a new element to the list.

- **`MyTuple`:**
    - Inherits from `DataContainer`.
    - `try_modify_element`: Attempts to modify an element, demonstrating that tuples are immutable (it will raise a `TypeError`).

- **Main Code:**
    - Creates a `MyList` and a `MyTuple` instance.
    - Displays their initial data.
    - Modifies and appends to the list, showing its mutability.
    - Attempts to modify the tuple, highlighting its immutability.

**Key Points Illustrated:**

- **Mutability:** Lists are mutable (can be changed), while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
- **Common Operations:** Both lists and tuples support common operations like indexing, slicing, and getting the length.
- **Inheritance:** The classes demonstrate inheritance, where `MyList` and `MyTuple` inherit common functionalities from the base class `DataContainer`.
- **Error Handling:** The `try-except` block gracefully handles the `TypeError` raised when attempting to modify a tuple.


Absolutely, you can create these classes in three different Python files. This promotes modularity and code organization, especially as your project grows. Here's how you would structure it:

**File 1: `data_container.py`**

```python
class DataContainer:
    """Base class for data containers (lists and tuples)."""

    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def display_data(self):
        """Displays the contained data."""
        print(self.data)

    def get_length(self):
        """Returns the length (number of elements) of the data."""
        return len(self.data)
```

**File 2: `my_list.py`**

```python
from data_container import DataContainer  # Import the base class

class MyList(DataContainer):
    """Represents a list (mutable sequence)."""

    def modify_element(self, index, new_value):
        """Modifies an element at the specified index."""
        if 0 <= index < self.get_length():
            self.data[index] = new_value
        else:
            print("Invalid index for modification.")

    def append_element(self, new_value):
        """Appends a new element to the end of the list."""
        self.data.append(new_value)
```

**File 3: `my_tuple.py`**

```python
from data_container import DataContainer  # Import the base class

class MyTuple(DataContainer):
    """Represents a tuple (immutable sequence)."""

    def try_modify_element(self, index, new_value):
        """Attempts to modify an element (will raise an error)."""
        try:
            self.data[index] = new_value
        except TypeError:
            print("Tuples are immutable. Modification not allowed.")
```

**File 4: `main.py` (or any other file where you want to use these classes)**

```python
from my_list import MyList
from my_tuple import MyTuple

# ... (rest of your code using MyList and MyTuple)
```

**Explanation:**

1. We've separated each class into its own file, making the code more organized and manageable.

2. In `my_list.py` and `my_tuple.py`, we import the `DataContainer` class from `data_container.py` to establish the inheritance relationship.

3. In the file where you want to use these classes (e.g., `main.py`), you import the specific classes you need.

**Benefits of this approach:**

* **Modularity:** Each file focuses on a specific class, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
* **Reusability:** You can import and use these classes in other projects without having to copy-paste the entire code.
* **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on different files simultaneously, improving productivity.

Remember to save each file with the corresponding `.py` extension (e.g., `data_container.py`, `my_list.py`, `my_tuple.py`).



## Similarities & Differences between List and Tuple in Python

**Similarities**

* **Ordered Collection:** Both lists and tuples store an ordered collection of items. This means that the items maintain their relative positions within the structure. 
* **Heterogeneous Elements:** Both can contain elements of different data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, even other lists or tuples). 
* **Indexing and Slicing:** You can access elements in both using indexing (e.g., `my_list[0]`, `my_tuple[2]`) and slicing (e.g., `my_list[1:3]`, `my_tuple[:2]`).
* **Iterable:** They are both iterable, meaning you can loop through their elements using a `for` loop.

**Differences**

* **Mutability:**
    * **List:** Mutable - You can modify a list after its creation (add, remove, or change elements). 
    * **Tuple:** Immutable - Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed.

* **Syntax:**
    * **List:** Defined using square brackets `[]`.
    * **Tuple:** Defined using parentheses `()`. An empty tuple is represented by `()` or `tuple()`. A tuple with a single element needs a trailing comma, e.g., `(1,)`.

* **Use Cases:**
    * **List:** Suitable when you need to modify the data frequently or the size of the collection might change.
    * **Tuple:** Ideal for storing data that should not be altered, such as coordinates, configuration settings, or database records. 

* **Performance:**
    * **Tuple:** Generally faster than lists for accessing elements because of their immutability.
    * **List:** Might be slightly slower for access but offers flexibility for modification.

* **Methods:**
    * **List:** Has several built-in methods for modification (e.g., `append`, `insert`, `remove`, `pop`).
    * **Tuple:** Has fewer built-in methods as it's immutable (e.g., `count`, `index`).

**Choosing the Right One**

* Use a **list** when you need to:
    - Change the contents of the collection
    - Add or remove elements
    - Have a collection whose size may vary

* Use a **tuple** when you need to:
    - Ensure data integrity and prevent accidental modifications
    - Store a fixed set of values
    - Use the collection as a dictionary key (tuples are hashable, lists are not)
